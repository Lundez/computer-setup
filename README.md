# Bash
My .bashrc's methods that aren't standard. For easy grabbing on different computers. 

`up x`
Where x is the amount of directories to. "up 2" = "cd ../../"

`extract filename`
Extract file independent of what kind of compression used. 

`mkcdir directory`
Makes directory (mkdir) *directory* and then goes into it (cd)

TODO update for lessfilter:
Also chmod u+x ~/.lessfilter on lessfilter file.
